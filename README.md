Hello there! 👋🏻
I'm Jan Vollmer, a 20 y/o dual computer science student. Wdym with dual student? As a dual student I study at university and work/earn practical skills in a partnering company outside of the semester. It's a form of study which is getting more and more common in Germany.

On GitHub, I'm just a simple young man trying to create useful, not seen before software in Open-Source style.

Although its not my particular favorite type of project, I tend to bring into action web-based ideas most of the time and have most experience in that space.
That is one of the reasons why I first started gaining advanced coding experience with Python 🐍 and most recently fell in love with TypeScript 🟦.

One of the other programming languages I want to learn soon is Rust 🦀, but I haven't found a suitable project idea for me to test it out yet 🤷🏻‍♂️.
Maybe it will reveal itself on one of the following stats sometime ⏳?

Besides being interested in anything related to computer science, I'm kind of a train nerd 🚂🤓.

Oh, and my music taste? I mostly listen to metal 🎸 and meme-type 🤪 music.
