Hello there! 👋🏻
But I'm not Kenobi. It's me, Jan Vollmer, a 20 y/o dual computer science student. What do I mean with dual student? As a dual student I study at university and work for / earn practical skills at a partnering company outside of the semester. It's a form of study which is getting more and more common in Germany.

On GitHub, I'm just a simple young man trying to create useful, not seen before software in Open-Source style.
</p>
<p align="center">
Although it's not my favorite type of project in particular, I tend to bring web-based ideas to fruition and have the most experience in this area.
That is one of the reasons why I first started gaining advanced coding experience with Python 🐍 and most recently fell in love with TypeScript 🟦.

One of the other programming languages I want to learn soon is Rust 🦀, but I haven't found a suitable project idea for me to test it out yet 🤷🏻‍♂️.
Maybe it will reveal itself on one of the following stats sometime ⏳?

Besides being interested in anything related to computer science, I'm kind of a train nerd 🚂🤓.

Oh, and my music taste? I mostly listen to metal 🎸 and meme-type 🤪 music.
