Hello there! 👋🏻


I'm just a simple young man trying to create useful, not seen before software in Open-Source style.

Although its not my particular favorite kind of project, I tend to create web-based ones most of the time and have most experience in that space.

That is one of the reasons why I first started gaining advanced coding experience with Python 🐍 and most recently fell in love with TypeScript 🟦.

One of the other programming languages I want to learn soon is Rust 🦀, but I haven't found a suitable project idea for me to test it out yet 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Maybe it will reveal itself on one of the following stats sometime ⏳?

Besides being interested in anything related to computer science, I'm kind of a train nerd 🚂🤓.
Oh, and my music taste? I mostly listen to metal 🎸 and meme-type 🤪 music.
